					</p>
					<h3>Building Repairs and Maintenance</h3>

					<p>
						This involves maintaining the organization’s buildings along with the building components and
						systems. The crux of this service is first, to create a good working/operating environment,
						second, to ensure occupational and operating safety, and third, to create an environment that
						engenders innovation and promotes productivity via the “feel-good” effect created. This service
						would both be preventive and reactive, with the reactive maintenance aspect reduced to the
						barest minimum. Activities to be performed would revolve around plumbing, HVAC,
						electrical/electronic works, painting amongst others.
					</p>
					<h3>Utility Maintenance and Management</h3>

					<p>
						Through this service, utilities being employed - such as water and power (energy) systems – are
						kept at their optimum operating conditions. The key to achieving this would be by equating
						maintenance to delivering reliability. With this fully understood processes that ensure
						reliability of utility facilities would be put in place. In addition, the need to properly match
						consumption with production so as to appropriate the utilities optimally, will lead to proper
						definitions of utilities requirements and usage. This in turn will yield reduction in costs.
						Developed plans and procedures guide the operation of this service.
					</p>
					<h3>Space Management</h3>

					<p>
						This is the planning and allocation of space in order to effectively support business
						activities. The flow of work operations and the ability for two or more operations to synergise
						are taken into consideration along with the critical nature of certain work operations. All
						these variables taken into consideration will give birth to the space management plan and
						deployment of the plan.
					</p>
					<h3>Access Control and Security</h3>

					<p>
						In an increasing nature, access control has become important in the operation of organizations.
						There is a need to allow or restrict access to both staff and visitors. It is also imperative
						that intruders/trespassers are not allowed to gain access into the premises. This calls the use
						of Access Control Systems along with security being put in place. The nature of security
						personnel and equipment deployed would depend on the requirements and location of managed
						facilities.
					</p>
					<h3>Waste Management & Cleaning</h3>

					<p>
						Waste generation is inevitable, therefore, there is a need to properly manage the collection,
						disposal, and a times the recycling. Processes, plans and systems are put in place in order to
						manage the generated waste. Though a cleaning service may seem generalized, it should be
						appreciated that in order to achieve effective cleaning of a premises, a cleaning system that is
						meant solely for the building and its facilities is developed and positioned to deliver an
						environment that is clean, not withstanding time or period.
					</p>
					<h3>Building Reconstruction and Special Projects:</h3>

					<p>
						Based on changing company needs, outlook and progression, there might be a need to reconstruct
						parts of a building or facility, be it externally or internally. This would involve the
						considerations of several factors, from engineering to cost issues. On the establishment of the
						requirements and sound consideration of the all issues and variables, a team is assembled to
						perform the work.
